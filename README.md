## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated computer engineering student in my 4th year at BÃ¼lent Ecevit University in Turkey.
I have a strong passion for coding and I am constantly honing my skills through various projects and learning experiences:)
            My personal slogan: "For me, who believes in the light, the world is always day."
